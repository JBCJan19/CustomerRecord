# Customer Record

A program that  reads a customer’s name,  purchase amount and  tax code.
The tax code is  validated and will be one of the following:
  *  0  tax exempt (0%)
  *  1  state sales tax only (3%)
  *  2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
  *  3  special sales tax (7%)

The program  then computes the sales tax and the total amount due,and prints the customer’s name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.
